Apple\\'s done a fantastic\\njob of really innovating on the Mac, we are gonna outperform them. - So you feel like you\\'ve got Apple now. - We have a computer for\\npeople who love Windows that they can be very, very proud of. - Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella is very excited about\\nhis new Windows computers because they\\'re not just\\nany Windows computers. Can we call \\'em AI-puters? - (laughs) No, I like Copilot+PC. - [Joanna] Yes, these Copilot+PCs coming from Microsoft itself and others like Lenovo and Dell have been completely re-engineered for. - AI, AI, AI, AI, AI as a new input. - But what even is an AI computer? Microsoft\\'s latest have\\nnew chips and AI software that can do some cool tricks without even needing to\\nconnect to the internet. After talking to Nadella and seeing the new\\nSurface devices in action, I\\'ll say it looks pretty darn promising. - Here\\'s the interesting thing, right? Which is, if you sort of take all of what we\\'ve been talking about with AI, it all came about because\\nof abundance of compute, all primarily in the cloud, right? So, that\\'s what created\\nthe GPT-4, for example, which essentially changed the world. Now, what happened in the cloud is going to come to the edge, and the edge that first\\nneeds to be reinvented before we talk about\\neverything else is the PC. And so, that\\'s sort of what\\nI think of as the AI PC or the Copilot+PCs. - Okay, translation for\\nnon-computer scientists. ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, those other generative AI\\ntools you\\'ve been using, the processing happens in the\\ncloud, AKA some data center. Now, some AI processing will\\nhappen right on your computer, what is called edge computing. To do this, Microsoft had\\nto add a new chip component. Pretend I\\'m not a computer nerd. What is an NPU? - It\\'s a neural processing unit. So, if you wanna build any AI application, you have to have an accelerator, just like we have in the cloud, to be able to run these matrix\\nmath multiplications fast in order to drive AI features. And that\\'s what the NPU does. - [Joanna] The NPU joins\\nthe CPU and the GPU in the Copilot+PCs. But here\\'s the really exciting thing. - Qualcomm\\'s got a new processor, which we\\'ve optimized Windows for. The battery lab, I\\'ve been using it now. I mean, it\\'s 22 hours of\\ncontinuous video playback. - [Joanna] These Qualcomm\\nSnapdragon X series chips are based on ARM architecture. And here\\'s another translation. These energy efficient\\nchips are more like the ones in your smartphone than the Intel chips in your Windows laptop. A few years ago, Apple\\ntransitioned all its Macs from Intel chips. - [Speaker] To our own Apple silicon. - [Joanna] Those chips are based on ARM, and it made MacBooks really awesome. - We finally feel we have\\na very competitive product between Surface Pro and\\nthe Surface laptops. We have essentially the best specs when it comes to ARM-based\\nsilicon and performance or the NPU performance. - Microsoft says the Surfaces are 58% faster than\\nthe MacBook Air with M3 and has 20% longer battery life. Intel will make Copilot PCs, but this is a move away from\\nthat once tight relationship. Which system do you use? - I use the Surface laptop. - Have you heard the fan go on? - No. - See, this is what I\\'m really hoping for, a Windows PC that doesn\\'t sound like it\\'s going to outer space. (Satya laughs) - You have it, you got it. - [Joanna] Okay, but what new AI powers does the NPU unlock in Windows? - One of the dreams we\\'ve always had is how do we introduce memory, right? Photographic memory into\\nwhat you do on the PC, and now we have it. So, it\\'s called Recall. It\\'s not keyword search, right? It\\'s semantic search\\nover all your history. And it\\'s not just about any document. We can recreate moments\\nfrom the past essentially. - Here\\'s how it works. Windows constantly takes screenshots of what\\'s on your screen. Then uses a generative AI\\nmodel right on the device along with the NPU to\\nprocess all that data and make it searchable, even photos. I got to try it out. I searched \"brown leather bag.\" It came up in visual search. There\\'s no place on this page that it says \"brown leather bag.\" It just knows because it\\nsees this brown leather bag. There could be this\\nreaction from some people that this is pretty creepy. Microsoft is taking\\nscreenshots of everything I do. - Yeah, I mean, that\\'s why that it can only do it on the edge, right? So this is, you have to\\nput two things together. This is my computer, this is my Recall, and it\\'s all being done locally, right? So that\\'s the promise. So, that\\'s one of the\\nreasons why Recall works as a magical thing, because I can trust it\\nthat it is on my computer. - You can also restrict\\nRecall from taking screenshots of certain websites or apps\\nor turn it off entirely. And it seems to me this whole next wave of AI computing is gonna be\\nbuilt somewhat around trust. If we\\'re gonna have AI agents that go out and do things for us, why should people trust\\nMicrosoft over another company? - And I think we are at\\nthe very early stages of understanding how our relationship with AI agents should be\\nshaped by us primarily because that\\'s the only\\nway to build trust. If somebody else, this\\nis not a vendor decision. It\\'s a personal, maybe\\neven spiritual decision of how we want to, and\\nthat\\'s why I don\\'t believe there\\'s just gonna be one, right? Because I may have multiple agents that I may want to delegate\\ndifferent types of things to. - [Joanna] There\\'s another\\nAI feature called Co-creator that runs locally right on the device. - How do we really take good old paint and say, \"Hey, I\\'m not\\njust painting myself, but I\\'m able to co-create with an AI.\" - You put in a text prompt,\\n\"a Windows XP wallpaper with a big green mountain,\" then start drawing and a stable diffusion\\nimage generation model right on the device starts\\nto generate an image based on your sketch. Yes, that\\'s very good. There\\'s local live translation, too. It can translate live video calls or in-person conversations from 44 different languages into English. And it\\'s fast. (woman speaking foreign language) Yeah, I have a dog. (woman speaking foreign language) Browser. All of this is powered\\nby small language models that are stored on the device. Large language models\\nlike chatGPT or Copilot still run in the cloud. In the coming weeks, Copilot will get open\\nAI\\'s latest GPT-4.0 model. - It\\'s kind of like a\\nnew browser effectively. So, it\\'s right there. It sees the screen, it sees\\nthe world, it hears you. And so, it\\'s kind of\\nlike that personal agent that\\'s always there\\nthat you wanna talk to. You can interrupt it. It can interrupt you. - The new Surfaces will\\nstart shipping in June, starting at 999. But I had a few more\\nquestions about the future. AI is this new type of way of\\ninteracting with computers. Yet here you\\'re releasing a\\npretty traditional looking type of computer. - You know, think about\\nwhat we did back in the day when the internet happened. It sort of like, the\\nbrowser was born on Windows and it went beyond Windows. That\\'s, I think, what\\'s gonna happen. That\\'s why I think we want to make sure we build the Copilot+PC that\\'s optimized for Copilot. But I fully expect the\\nCopilot to be everywhere. And the innovation of the\\ninterface of your personal agent, how I interact with it,\\nhow it accesses memories, how it does actions is\\ngonna be everywhere. It\\'s gonna be ambient. - Where else could it go? - It\\'ll go on the phone, right? I\\'ll use it on WhatsApp. I\\'ll use it on any other\\nmessaging platform. It\\'ll be on speakers everywhere. So, in some sense, it\\'ll be anywhere users want to interact with it with different modalities, right? If you take what GPTO showed and you combine it with\\nCopilot as the interface, for us, that\\'s the type of\\nmagic that we wanna bring. First to Windows and everywhere else. - What do you think about glasses? - Well, we loved glasses for a long time. In fact, one of the things\\nthat we will do with Meta is to take Copilot and really bring it to all of\\nthe work that they\\'re doing. - Can we close our eyes together and we\\'re gonna imagine the future of computing.\\n- Okay. - What is the future that you see? - The future I see is a\\ncomputer that understands me versus a computer that\\nI have to understand. - Okay, does it look like this? - It reminds me of XP. - This is what it turned it into. - Oh wow. - Could this be the\\nwallpaper of the future PC? - It definitely can be.

Can we call 'em AI-puters? - (laughs) No, I like Copilot+PC. - [Joanna] Yes, these Copilot+PCs coming from Microsoft itself and others like Lenovo and Dell have been completely re-engineered for. - AI, AI, AI, AI, AI as a new input. - But what even is an AI computer? Microsoft's latest have\nnew chips and AI software that can do some cool tricks without even needing to\nconnect to the internet. After talking to Nadella and seeing the new\nSurface devices in action, I'll say it looks pretty darn promising. - Here's the interesting thing, right? Which is, if you sort of take all of what we've been talking about with AI, it all came about because\nof abundance of compute, all primarily in the cloud, right? So, that's what created\nthe GPT-4, for example, which essentially changed the world. Now, what happened in the cloud is going to come to the edge, and the edge that first\nneeds to be reinvented before we talk about\neverything else is the PC. And so, that's sort of what\nI think of as the AI PC or the Copilot+PCs. - Okay, translation for\nnon-computer scientists. ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, those other generative AI\ntools you've been using, the processing happens in the\ncloud, AKA some data center. Now, some AI processing will\nhappen right on your computer, what is called edge computing. To do this, Microsoft had\nto add a new chip component. Pretend I'm not a computer nerd. What is an NPU? - It's a neural processing unit. So, if you wanna build any AI application, you have to have an accelerator, just like we have in the cloud, to be able to run these matrix\nmath multiplications fast in order to drive AI features. And that's what the NPU does. - [Joanna] The NPU joins\nthe CPU and the GPU in the Copilot+PCs. But here's the really exciting thing. - Qualcomm's got a new processor, which we've optimized Windows for. The battery lab, I've been using it now. I mean, it's 22 hours of\ncontinuous video playback. - [Joanna] These Qualcomm\nSnapdragon X series chips are based on ARM architecture. And here's another translation. These energy efficient\nchips are more like the ones in your smartphone than the Intel chips in your Windows laptop. A few years ago, Apple\ntransitioned all its Macs from Intel chips. - [Speaker] To our own Apple silicon. - [Joanna] Those chips are based on ARM, and it made MacBooks really awesome. - We finally feel we have\na very competitive product between Surface Pro and\nthe Surface laptops. We have essentially the best specs when it comes to ARM-based\nsilicon and performance or the NPU performance. - Microsoft says the Surfaces are 58% faster than\nthe MacBook Air with M3 and has 20% longer battery life. Intel will make Copilot PCs, but this is a move away from\nthat once tight relationship. Which system do you use? - I use the Surface laptop. - Have you heard the fan go on? - No. - See, this is what I'm really hoping for, a Windows PC that doesn't sound like it's going to outer space. (Satya laughs) - You have it, you got it. - [Joanna] Okay, but what new AI powers does the NPU unlock in Windows? - One of the dreams we've always had is how do we introduce memory, right? Photographic memory into\nwhat you do on the PC, and now we have it. So, it's called Recall. It's not keyword search, right? It's semantic search\nover all your history. And it's not just about any document. We can recreate moments\nfrom the past essentially. - Here's how it works. Windows constantly takes screenshots of what's on your screen. Then uses a generative AI\nmodel right on the device along with the NPU to\nprocess all that data and make it searchable, even photos. I got to try it out. I searched \"brown leather bag.\" It came up in visual search. There's no place on this page that it says \"brown leather bag.\" It just knows because it\nsees this brown leather bag. There could be this\nreaction from some people that this is pretty creepy. Microsoft is taking\nscreenshots of everything I do. - Yeah, I mean, that's why that it can only do it on the edge, right? So this is, you have to\nput two things together. This is my computer, this is my Recall, and it's all being done locally, right? So that's the promise. So, that's one of the\nreasons why Recall works as a magical thing, because I can trust it\nthat it is on my computer. - You can also restrict\nRecall from taking screenshots of certain websites or apps\nor turn it off entirely. And it seems to me this whole next wave of AI computing is gonna be\nbuilt somewhat around trust. If we're gonna have AI agents that go out and do things for us, why should people trust\nMicrosoft over another company? - And I think we are at\nthe very early stages of understanding how our relationship with AI agents should be\nshaped by us primarily because that's the only\nway to build trust. If somebody else, this\nis not a vendor decision. It's a personal, maybe\neven spiritual decision of how we want to, and\nthat's why I don't believe there's just gonna be one, right? Because I may have multiple agents that I may want to delegate\ndifferent types of things to. - [Joanna] There's another\nAI feature called Co-creator that runs locally right on the device. - How do we really take good old paint and say, \"Hey, I'm not\njust painting myself, but I'm able to co-create with an AI.\" - You put in a text prompt,\n\"a Windows XP wallpaper with a big green mountain,\" then start drawing and a stable diffusion\nimage generation model right on the device starts\nto generate an image based on your sketch. Yes, that's very good. There's local live translation, too. It can translate live video calls or in-person conversations from 44 different languages into English. And it's fast. (woman speaking foreign language) Yeah, I have a dog. (woman speaking foreign language) Browser. All of this is powered\nby small language models that are stored on the device. Large language models\nlike chatGPT or Copilot still run in the cloud. In the coming weeks, Copilot will get open\nAI's latest GPT-4.0 model. - It's kind of like a\nnew browser effectively. So, it's right there. It sees the screen, it sees\nthe world, it hears you. And so, it's kind of\nlike that personal agent that's always there\nthat you wanna talk to. You can interrupt it. It can interrupt you. - The new Surfaces will\nstart shipping in June, starting at 999. But I had a few more\nquestions about the future. AI is this new type of way of\ninteracting with computers. Yet here you're releasing a\npretty traditional looking type of computer. - You know, think about\nwhat we did back in the day when the internet happened. It sort of like, the\nbrowser was born on Windows and it went beyond Windows. That's, I think, what's gonna happen. That's why I think we want to make sure we build the Copilot+PC that's optimized for Copilot. But I fully expect the\nCopilot to be everywhere. And the innovation of the\ninterface of your personal agent, how I interact with it,\nhow it accesses memories, how it does actions is\ngonna be everywhere. It's gonna be ambient. - Where else could it go? - It'll go on the phone, right? I'll use it on WhatsApp. I'll use it on any other\nmessaging platform. It'll be on speakers everywhere. So, in some sense, it'll be anywhere users want to interact with it with different modalities, right? If you take what GPTO showed and you combine it with\nCopilot as the interface, for us, that's the type of\nmagic that we wanna bring. First to Windows and everywhere else. - What do you think about glasses? - Well, we loved glasses for a long time. In fact, one of the things\nthat we will do with Meta is to take Copilot and really bring it to all of\nthe work that they're doing. - Can we close our eyes together and we're gonna imagine the future of computing.\n- Okay. - What is the future that you see? - The future I see is a\ncomputer that understands me versus a computer that\nI have to understand. - Okay, does it look like this? - It reminds me of XP. - This is what it turned it into. - Oh wow. - Could this be the\nwallpaper of the future PC? - It definitely can be. And you have the power to do it, Joanna. You can set your wallpaper on Windows. - Well, I wanna leave this with you and maybe you can make this\nthe default in Windows 12. - Thank you so much.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(result)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-27T08:05:20.300284Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-27T08:05:20.300564Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-27T08:05:20.305240Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-27T08:05:20.300543Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-27T08:05:20.304369Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"- Apple's done a fantastic job of really innovating on the Mac. we are gonna outperform them - So you feel like you've got Apple now. - We have a computer for people who love Windows that they can be very, very proud of. - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is very excited about his new Windows computers, because they're not just any Windows computers.

text is an interview between Joanna and an unnamed Microsoft executive, discussing Microsoft's new Copilot+PCs, which are designed to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the Windows operating system. The executive highlights the innovative features of these new computers, such as:\n\n1. AI-processed graphics and images: The Copilot+PCs can generate photorealistic images and graphics without needing to connect to the internet.\n2. Edge computing: The NPU (Neural Processing Unit) join the CPU and GPU, enabling local processing of AI tasks.\n3. Recall: A new AI-powered search feature that can recreate moments from the past and recall specific information.\n4. Co-creator: An AI-powered drawing tool that allows users to co-create with an AI model.\n\nThe executive also discusses the trust aspect of AI and how Microsoft is addressing this issue by allowing users to control and restrict the data collected by the AI models. He also mentions the future of AI computing, where AI agents will be integrated into daily life, including phones, speakers, and messaging platforms.\n\nThe interview concludes with the executive imagining a future where a computer understands the user, rather than the user having to understand the computer. He envisions a future where AI-powered computers are integrated into daily life, and users can interact with them in various ways, such as through speech, gestures, or eye movements.","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
